# Introduction to Design Science 

:Abstract: **Design science is a framework** relevant for research within
technology. It is about research that aims to create artifacts that solve
or improve a specific problem in the real world. When you a write a
thesis within technology, you will most likely benefit from applying or
at least knowing about design science. **This seminar is an
introduction to design science**. 
The goal is to provide an overview of the most important
concepts for students that start with their thesis, and serve as an introduction for own learning afterwards.

:goals: After successfully going through this seminar, you will be able to:

  - Understand the difference between the scientific process for natural sciences and the differences to design science, and be able to explain this difference to others.
  - Distinguish between knowledge questions and design problems, and identify them in daily work.
  - Recite all tasks part of the design cycle to create new artifacts.

With respect to your thesis, these skills will enable you to:

  - Write a better problem statement for your thesis.
  - Write a better research plan for your thesis.
  - Understand the difference between what you do in your thesis and what you write about, and what the contribution of your thesis is.
  - Be more aware of the important work you need to conduct in order to
produce results.
  - Reflect better about your work in general.
