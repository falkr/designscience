# Introduction to Design Science 

:Abstract: **Design science is a framework** relevant for research within
technology, that is, research that tries to create artifacts that solve
or improve a specific problem in the real world. When you a write a
thesis within technology, you can most likely benefit from applying or
at least knowing about design science. **This document is an
introduction to design science** and intended as preparation material
for a seminar. The goal is to provide an overview of the most important
concepts for students that start with their thesis. In this seminar we
can only provide you with a good start into design science, but there
are many articles and books on design science that you can refer to
later once you progress with your thesis.


## Learning Goals of this Seminar


:goals: After successfully going through this seminar, you will be able to:

  - Understand the difference between the scientific process for natural sciences and the differences to design science, and be able to explain this difference to others.
  - Distinguish between knowledge questions and design problems, and identify them in daily work.
  - Recite all tasks part of the design cycle to create new artifacts.
  - With respect to your thesis, these skills will enable you to:
  - Write a better problem statement for your thesis.
  - Write a better research plan for your thesis.
  - Understand the difference between what you do in your thesis and what you write about, and what the contribution of your thesis is.
  - Be more aware of the important work you need to conduct in order to
produce results.
  - Reflect better about your work in general.
  
  
:aside: Come back to these learning goals after the entire seminar and check if you have reached them.


## Learning Plan

This seminar is organized into three parts, following the method of
team-based learning that you may already be familiar with.

    through on your own.

2.  There will be a readiness assurance test on this material at the
    beginning of the seminar, both individual and in teams.

3.  We will apply the knowledge on design science in the seminar and
    make some exercises on design science.
